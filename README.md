## Problem Statement

In the dynamic landscape of the telecommunications industry, customers wield the power to choose from a plethora of service providers for their communication and internet needs. Customer satisfaction plays a pivotal role as users often form opinions about an entire company based on a single interaction. The ubiquitous nature of communication services, intertwined with our daily lives, underscores the significance of understanding and mitigating customer churn.

Churn rate, a key metric representing the number of customers who terminate or do not renew their subscriptions, directly impacts revenue. Given the high costs associated with acquiring new customers, an in-depth churn analysis is imperative. Insights derived from this analysis empower companies to formulate strategic approaches, target specific segments, enhance service quality, and ultimately foster trust with their customers. Building predictive models and generating comprehensive reports through churn analysis thus becomes instrumental in driving sustainable growth.

## Aim

The primary objective is to develop a robust predictive model capable of classifying potential churn customers based on a comprehensive set of numerical and categorical features. This poses a binary classification challenge, considering the inherent imbalance in the dataset.
